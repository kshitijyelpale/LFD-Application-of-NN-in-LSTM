# Applications of Neural Networks with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Project Details:
This was a research project carried out under a module, **Learning from Data**, in the Master's Course, High Integrity Systems at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. We have demonstrated the real-world use of Neural Networks with LSTMs in Sentiment Analysis. We have created several Deep Learning (LSTM) models depicting the same. Please find the project report [here.](Documentation/LSTM_report.pdf)
